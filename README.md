# Epsilon Ethical Hacking CTF Write-up

## Overview
This repository contains a detailed write-up of the **Epsilon CTF**, completed as part of **EECE 503G**. It documents the methodology, tools, and techniques used to exploit vulnerabilities and acquire root access.

## Report
The full step-by-step methodology, findings, and remediation strategies are documented in **Epsilon-CTF_Report.docx**.

## Key Areas Covered
- **Reconnaissance & Enumeration**: Nmap, Masscan, Dirbuster, Nikto
- **Exploitation**: Web vulnerabilities (SQLi, XSS, OS command injection), brute force attacks, privilege escalation
- **Post-Exploitation & Forensics**: Password cracking, network sniffing, steganography analysis
- **Remediation & Mitigation**: Hardening FTP, SSH, MySQL, and web services; improving authentication security; patching system vulnerabilities

## Virtual Machine
This virtual machine is essentially an improved version of [Book-Shelf](https://download.vulnhub.com/bookshelf/Book-shelf.7z)

## Purpose
This project emphasizes **both offensive (red team) and defensive (blue team) security** strategies, focusing on identifying vulnerabilities and proposing **effective remediation techniques** to enhance system security.
